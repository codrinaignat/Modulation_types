# Modulation_types

Matlab application structure:
- Apl6.drawio -> schematic of the modulation types implemented in Matlab;
- Apl6.fig -> the GUI of the app;
- Apl6.m -> the script behind the GUI, this is where the functionalities are implemented;
- AppInfo.fig and AppInfo.m are the files where the Info button functionality is implemented;
- Help.fig and Help.m are the files where the Help button functionality is implemented. It provides some basic information for the user when pressed from the main GUI.

Functionalities:
- this is a didactic application which shows the basic types of modulations used in telecommunications and computers;
- the implemented modulation types are: AM, FM, PM, ASK, FSK, PSK, QAM, PAM, PWM, PPM, PCM;
- you can set the parameters values from the main user interface (which opens when you run Apl6.m file);
- you can see the modulating, carrier and modulated signals in different plots. Also you will see the spectrum for some types of signals.
